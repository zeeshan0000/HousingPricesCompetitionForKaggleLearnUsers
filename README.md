# HousingPricesCompetitionForKaggleLearnUsers
A project dedicated to predicting house sale prices for the Kaggle Housing Prices Competition. This notebook demonstrates a custom gradient descent approach for a linear regression model (complete with manual feature engineering, normalization, and predictions)

## Overview
In this project:

Load and explore the Ames, Iowa housing dataset (train and test CSVs).
Engineer features such as TotalYears (house age) and TotalYearsRemodel.
Implement a manual gradient descent function to optimize the parameters of a multi-feature linear regression model.
Predict the final house prices and prepare a submission file for Kaggle.
The notebook exemplifies the fundamentals of linear regression, cost functions, gradient computation, feature normalization, and model evaluation (though for brevity, we do a direct cost check rather than a formal RMSE approach).

# Dataset

Train.csv: Contains 1460 rows with 79 explanatory variables plus SalePrice (the target).
Test.csv: Contains 1459 rows with the same explanatory variables (no SalePrice).
Submission: Generated in the notebook as submission.csv.
These files come from the “Housing Prices Competition for Kaggle Learn Users” dataset. If you’d like to run the code, download the data from Kaggle and place them in the same directory as the notebook.

# Key Observations
Custom Implementation: We coded a gradient descent approach from scratch rather than using off-the-shelf libraries like scikit-learn. This is great for understanding how linear regression works under the hood.

Feature Selection: We used a subset of features (27 numeric columns). More extensive feature engineering could improve accuracy.

Performance: While this approach works, real-world competition solutions often use advanced models (XGBoost, LightGBM) or ensembles.

# Future Improvements
Regularization: Incorporate L1 or L2 regularization to combat overfitting.
More Feature Engineering: Explore additional transformations, interaction terms, or domain-specific insights.
Advanced Models: Experiment with RandomForestRegressor or XGBRegressor from sklearn and xgboost libraries.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Automate learning-rate and iteration tuning with cross-validation.
